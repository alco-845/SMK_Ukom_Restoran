# Installation on localhost using XAMPP 
- Extract source code under htdocs folder. 
- Access the localhost URL followed by folder name. (example: http://localhost/UkomSMK) 
- The default route is user menu, if you want to go to admin menu just add "admin" in the URL but you have to login first as admin. (example: http://localhost/UkomSMK/admin)
